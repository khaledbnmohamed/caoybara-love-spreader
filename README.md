## Story behind

A good friend of mine was having a tough time and was seeking validation from people through social networks - who don't?! - especially "ask.fm", So I thought about coding a micro-program that floods him with quotes/advice I use whenever I feel down.

I also thought it would be nice when he opens and see a bunch of new notifications on a link he didn't think anyone might react with.

## Technology used:

I used automation testing tools called Capybara with selenium driver to find his account, seed the quotes from a text file. Check ask.fm's terms and conditions and waits for a few seconds through submitting to prevent any non-human alert. which is very basic application for the rspec e2e testing but in a different form

Video for how it looks from my account -of course-:

You might need it for a friend or someone you care about.

tl;dr: I coded a few lines that open my friend's ask.fm account and spam him with quotes/advice to spread love
